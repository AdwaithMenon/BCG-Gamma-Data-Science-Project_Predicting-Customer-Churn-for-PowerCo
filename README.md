# _BCG Gamma Data Science Project: Predicting Customer Churn for PowerCo Utility Company_

## **Project Description**

PowerCo, a significant gas and electricity provider, caters to a broad range of clients, including corporate, Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), and residential customers. However, the liberalization of the energy market in Europe has resulted in considerable customer churn, particularly in the SME sector. To tackle this issue, PowerCo has joined forces with BCG to investigate the root cause of the SME customer churn.

The Hypothesis is that "Customer Churn is affected by Price Sensitivity".

The objective of this project is to create a classification model capable of detecting SME clients who are more likely to churn if PowerCo maintains its current prices. Furthermore, the aim is to identify the most significant factors/predictors associated with customer churn. Upon analysis, recommendations will be made to enhance customer retention.
